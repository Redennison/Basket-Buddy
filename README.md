# Basket Buddy

## Project Overview
Basket Buddy is a real-time basketball shot-tracking application developed between October and December 2023. It combines hardware and software technologies to offer a comprehensive solution for basketball players to track and improve their shooting skills.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Shot Tracking**: Utilizes Raspberry Pi 4B combined with distance and vibration sensors to track every shot in real-time.
- **Mobile Application**: A React Native mobile app with a user-friendly dashboard displaying real-time shooting stats, historical performance trends, and an interactive calendar for progress tracking.
- **Back-End Infrastructure**: Built on Flask and MongoDB, our back-end efficiently processes sensor data and communicates with the mobile app through RESTful APIs.

## Technology Stack
- **Front-End**: React Native
- **Back-End**: Flask, MongoDB
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4B, Distance Sensors, Vibration Sensors
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs for data transmission between the back-end and the app
